This is the readme.1st file for the Packages Provided to for Psychometrika Authors

WHAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE:

At this time we offer two packages for authors who use LaTeX2e.
+ Version 1B1 and Version 2A1

For Version 1 instructions, see the ``readme.txt'' file in the Version1B1 directory.
For Version 2 instructions, see the ``howto.pdf'' and ``howto.tex'' files in 
the Version2A1 directory.

These packages were last updated on 4 March 2002

Users who have used Version 1 in the past, and who were satisfied, can continue
to use that version. Both versions will be supported and updated as the need 
arises. Authors who have not used Version 1 should probably use Version 2. For
more information on these package consult the ``howto.pdf'' file in the 
Version2A1 directory.
